vjepa2:

Enables the following:
- Recognizing objects, actions, and motions within videos
- Inferring physical properties like gravity and object permanence
- Understanding cause-and-effect relationships
- Allows predicting future states of the world
- Allows predicting outcomes of hypothetical actions
- Allows AI agents to plan sequences of actions to achieve specific goals. 

V-JEPA 2-AC trained to predict representations of the next video frame given an end-effector Cartesian control action. 
- Limitations: Sensitive to camera positioning, long-horizon planning is limited. 

New Benchmarks:
- IntPhys2: Examples model's ability to recognize plausible and implausible physics
- MVPBench: TEsts AI model on how well it understands any videos used for training
- CausalCQA: Scords ability to understand basic cause-and-effect
